<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

In this project I have created a user interface to interact with TheCatApi // Developer Experience API. I used a hamburger style menu to hold a list of different cat breeds. Select one of the breeds listed on the menu and a picture of that type of cat will be displayed.
